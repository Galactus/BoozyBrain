Software requirements needed to implement the code
Python 3.7
Beautiful soup 4 Library for python 3.7
slugify library for python for python 3.7
nltk natural language processing toolkit for python 3.7

The program has been adapted from the repository 'https://github.com/philipperemy/cocktails'

You will find the required datasets in the folder 'data'
Incase you want to extract the data again and start from scrtach, run the file 1_rate_binary_dataset.py
The required functions are coded in file utils.py . 
Note: you could run into problems generating the dataset from scratch as the website is in french and it is likely that the code has to be
altered sometimes to account for some french characters if they haven't be accounted for.


For running the prototype: 
1. Plugin the arduino to the computer and upload the code LED_
2. Note the COM port number and change it in the itertools_test.py file
3. Enter the ingredients in the variable array ingredients in itertools_test.py
4. Run the file itertools_test.py
